# Task Pinning Feature PRD v1.0

## Product overview

### Document title/version
Task Pinning Feature for Voice Memory Knowledge Page - Version 1.0

### Product summary
This product requirements document outlines the implementation of a task pinning feature for the Voice Memory knowledge page. The feature will enable users to pin important tasks to the top of their task list, ensuring critical action items remain visible and easily accessible regardless of applied filters or sorting options. This enhancement addresses the need for better task prioritization and management within the existing voice-to-task workflow.

## Goals

### Business goals
- Increase user engagement with the task management features by 25%
- Improve task completion rates through better visibility of priority items
- Reduce time users spend searching for critical tasks by 40%
- Enhance the overall value proposition of Voice Memory as a comprehensive productivity tool

### User goals
- Quickly identify and access high-priority tasks without scrolling or filtering
- Maintain focus on critical action items across multiple sessions
- Organize tasks more effectively without losing track of important items
- Reduce cognitive load by having important tasks always visible

### Non-goals
- Creating a complex task hierarchy or subtask system
- Implementing task prioritization beyond simple pinning
- Building a full-featured project management system
- Adding task dependencies or Gantt chart functionality
- Changing the existing task creation workflow from voice notes

## User personas

## User experience

### Entry points
1. **Knowledge page task list**: Primary entry point through pin icon on each task
2. **Task context menu**: Right-click option to pin/unpin
3. **Keyboard shortcut**: Ctrl/Cmd + P when task is focused
4. **Search results**: Pin option available on task search results

### Core experience
1. User navigates to the knowledge page and views their task list
2. User identifies an important task that needs priority attention
3. User clicks the pin icon (üìå) next to the task
4. Task immediately moves to the pinned section at the top with animation
5. Pinned section shows with a subtle background color and "Pinned Tasks" header
6. User continues working with pinned tasks always visible
7. When task is no longer priority, user clicks unpin icon
8. Task returns to its normal position in the list with animation

### Advanced features
- **Smart unpinning**: Completed pinned tasks auto-unpin after 24 hours
- **Pin limit warning**: Alert when approaching 10-task pin limit
- **Quick pin mode**: Hold Shift to pin multiple tasks rapidly
- **Pin from anywhere**: Pin tasks from search results or timeline view

### UI/UX highlights
- **Visual hierarchy**: Pinned section with light yellow background (#FEF3C7)
- **Pin icon states**: Empty pin (üìå) for unpinned, filled pin (üìç) for pinned
- **Smooth animations**: 300ms slide animation when pinning/unpinning
- **Responsive design**: Pinned section adapts to mobile view
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Loading states**: Optimistic UI updates with rollback on error

## Narrative
Sarah, a product manager, starts her Monday by recording a voice note during her commute: "Follow up with engineering team about the API changes, prepare slides for tomorrow's board presentation, and review Q4 roadmap with design team." When she arrives at the office and opens Voice Memory, she sees these three tasks among twenty others from the past week. She quickly pins the board presentation task to the top since it's due tomorrow. Throughout the day, as she records more notes and creates additional tasks, the pinned presentation task remains prominently displayed at the top of her list. Even when she filters to see only delegated tasks or switches to the completed view, her pinned priority items stay visible. This constant visibility ensures she doesn't forget about the critical presentation amidst her busy day.

## Success metrics

### User-centric
- **Task completion rate**: 20% increase in completion rate for pinned tasks vs unpinned
- **Time to task**: 50% reduction in time to locate and act on priority tasks  
- **Feature adoption**: 60% of active users use pinning within first month
- **User satisfaction**: 4.5+ star rating for task management features
- **Return usage**: 80% of users who pin a task use the feature again within a week

### Business
- **Daily active users**: 15% increase in daily knowledge page visits
- **Session duration**: 10% increase in average time on knowledge page
- **Feature retention**: 70% of pinning users still active after 30 days
- **Support tickets**: Less than 5% increase in task-related support requests
- **Upgrade conversion**: 10% increase in free-to-paid conversions for heavy pinning users

### Technical
- **Performance**: Pin/unpin operations complete in under 200ms
- **Reliability**: 99.9% success rate for pin state persistence
- **Sync time**: Pin state syncs across devices within 2 seconds
- **Database efficiency**: Pin queries add less than 10ms to page load
- **API latency**: Pin API endpoints respond in under 100ms p95

## Technical considerations

### Integration points
- **Supabase database**: New `task_pins` table with user_id, task_id, pinned_at columns
- **React state management**: Update existing task state to include pin status
- **API endpoints**: New `/api/tasks/[id]/pin` POST and DELETE endpoints
- **Knowledge API**: Modify `/api/knowledge` to include pin status in response
- **Task completion flow**: Ensure pin status persists through completion state changes

### Data storage/privacy
- **Pin data structure**: Separate `task_pins` table to avoid modifying core task structure
- **User isolation**: Row-level security ensures users can only pin their own tasks
- **Data retention**: Pin data deleted when associated task/note is deleted
- **Privacy**: No PII stored in pin records, only user_id and task_id references
- **Audit trail**: Track pinned_at timestamp for analytics and auto-unpin feature

### Scalability/performance
- **Caching strategy**: Cache pinned task IDs in React context for instant UI updates
- **Query optimization**: Composite index on (user_id, task_id) for fast lookups
- **Batch operations**: Support bulk pin/unpin to reduce API calls
- **Pagination**: Pinned tasks counted separately from main task pagination
- **Real-time sync**: Use Supabase real-time subscriptions for multi-device sync

### Potential challenges
- **State synchronization**: Managing pin state between optimistic UI and database
- **Filter complexity**: Ensuring pinned tasks appear correctly with all filter combinations
- **Performance impact**: Additional database join may slow initial page load
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Limited screen space for pinned section on mobile
- **Edge cases**: Handling deleted tasks, permission changes, and data migrations
