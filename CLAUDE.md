### Technical Implementation Details:

**Enhanced Analysis Structure**:
```typescript
interface NoteAnalysis {
  // Original 7-point framework
  sentiment: { classification, explanation }
  focusTopics: { primary, minor }
  tasks: { myTasks, delegatedTasks }
  keyIdeas: string[]
  messagesToDraft: Array<{recipient, subject, body}>
  crossReferences: { relatedNotes, projectKnowledgeUpdates }
  outreachIdeas: Array<{contact, topic, purpose}>
  
  // NEW: Structured data extraction
  structuredData: {
    dates: Array<{date, context, type}>
    times: Array<{time, context, type}>  // e.g., "arrival at airstrip"
    locations: Array<{place, context, type}>
    numbers: Array<{value, context, type}>
    people: Array<{name, context, relationship}>
  }
  
  // NEW: Recording context
  recordingContext: {
    recordedAt: string
    extractedDate?: string
    timeReferences: string[]
  }
}
```

**Example Enhanced Extraction**:
- **Input**: "I arrived at the airstrip at 3:30 PM to meet Carlos about the land project"
- **Output**: 
  - `times: [{"time": "3:30 PM", "context": "arrived at the airstrip", "type": "arrival"}]`

);
```

**Enhanced UI Components**:
```typescript
// ProcessingStatus with error tracking
interface ProcessingStats {
  total: number
  pending: number
  processing: number
  completed: number
  failed: number
  error_rate?: number
}
