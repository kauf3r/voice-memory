  - Modified UploadButton to send Bearer token with upload requests
  - Server now successfully receives auth header and validates token
  - Current issue: RLS policy blocking inserts (403: "new row violates row-level security policy")
  - Solution: Need to configure Supabase RLS policies for notes table to allow authenticated users to insert

- Extended debugging session (2025-07-19 continued):
  - Fixed RLS "new row violates row-level security policy" error
  - Root cause: User ID mismatch - auth user ID didn't match users table record
  - Found 3 different user IDs in database from development testing
  - Solution: Updated users table to use current auth user ID (d8a35e1b-3653-4f9c-bb0c-a8d07b5eb0e8)
  - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors:
