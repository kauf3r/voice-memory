## ðŸš€ How to Use Subagents

### Automatic Invocation
Claude will automatically select the appropriate subagent based on your task:

```
You: "I need to optimize the database queries for the knowledge page"
Claude: [Automatically uses supabase-expert]
```

### Explicit Invocation
You can also explicitly request a specific subagent:

```
You: "Use the ai-analysis-enhancer to help me improve sentiment analysis"
```

### Multiple Subagents
Complex tasks may involve multiple subagents:

```
You: "Implement a new feature for batch audio processing with tests"
Claude: [May use voice-transcription-optimizer + test-automation]
```

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

1. **Let Claude Choose**: Usually, Claude will automatically select the right subagent
2. **Be Specific**: Provide clear context about what you're trying to achieve
3. **Chain Subagents**: For complex features, multiple subagents may collaborate
4. **Review Output**: Subagents provide specialized advice - review and adapt as needed
