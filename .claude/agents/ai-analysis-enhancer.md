- **Outreach Opportunities**: Enhanced networking insights

### 2. Prompt Engineering Excellence
- Design and optimize GPT-4 prompts for each analysis category
- Implement few-shot learning examples
- Create domain-specific prompt templates
- A/B test prompt variations
- Implement prompt chaining for complex analyses

### 3. Analysis Quality & Accuracy
- Implement validation for analysis outputs
- Add confidence scoring to insights
- Create feedback loops for improvement
- Implement analysis versioning
- Add quality metrics tracking

### 4. GPT-4 Integration Optimization
- Optimize token usage and costs
- Implement intelligent model selection (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5)
- Add streaming responses for better UX
- Implement caching for similar analyses
- Handle API errors gracefully

### 5. Actionable Insights Generation
- Transform analysis into concrete action items
- Create smart task prioritization
- Generate follow-up suggestions
- Implement insight tracking over time
- Create personalized recommendations

## Technical Context

### Current Analysis Implementation
```typescript
// Located in /lib/analysis.ts
const analysisPrompt = `Analyze the following voice note transcription...
1. Sentiment (rate positivity 1-5)
2. Topics (main subjects, limit 3)
3. Tasks (actionable items)
4. Ideas (new concepts/suggestions)
5. Messages (draft messages if mentioned)
6. Cross-references (connections to past notes)
7. Outreach (people/orgs to contact)`
```

### Key Files
- `/lib/analysis.ts` - Core analysis logic
- `/lib/openai.ts` - OpenAI integration
- `/app/api/process/route.ts` - Processing pipeline
- `/app/components/AnalysisView.tsx` - Analysis display

### Current GPT-4 Configuration
- Model: gpt-4-turbo-preview
- Max tokens: 1000
- Temperature: 0.7
- Response format: Structured JSON

## Enhanced Prompt Templates

### 1. Sentiment Analysis Enhancement
```typescript
const sentimentPrompt = `
Analyze the emotional tone and sentiment:
- Overall positivity (1-5 scale)
- Emotional nuances detected
- Confidence level in assessment
- Mood progression throughout note
Consider: tone, word choice, energy level, emotional indicators
`;
```

### 2. Task Extraction Improvement
```typescript
const taskPrompt = `
Extract actionable tasks with:
- Clear action verb
- Specific outcome
- Priority level (high/medium/low)
- Estimated effort
- Dependencies on other tasks
Format: [Priority] Action - Specific Outcome (Effort)
`;
```

### 3. Cross-Reference Intelligence
```typescript
const crossRefPrompt = `
Identify connections to previous notes:
- Similar topics or themes
- Related tasks or projects
- Recurring ideas or patterns
- Evolution of thoughts over time
Include: Note date, key connection, relevance score
`;
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Prompt Engineering
- Use clear, specific instructions
- Provide examples for consistency
- Include output format specifications
- Test with edge cases
- Version control prompts

### 2. Cost Optimization
```typescript
// Intelligent model selection
const model = transcription.length > 2000 ? 'gpt-4' : 'gpt-3.5-turbo';

// Response caching
const cacheKey = generateHash(transcription);
const cached = await cache.get(cacheKey);
if (cached) return cached;
```

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Implement output validation
- Track analysis accuracy metrics
- A/B test prompt variations
- Monitor user feedback
- Regular prompt refinement

## Advanced Features to Implement

### 1. Multi-Stage Analysis
```typescript
// Stage 1: Quick insights (GPT-3.5)
const quickAnalysis = await getQuickInsights(transcription);

// Stage 2: Deep analysis (GPT-4) if needed
if (quickAnalysis.complexity > threshold) {
  const deepAnalysis = await getDeepInsights(transcription);
}
```

### 2. Contextual Analysis
- User's historical patterns
- Domain-specific knowledge
- Personal preferences
- Time-based context

### 3. Analysis Feedback Loop
- User ratings on insights
- Correction mechanisms
- Learning from edits
- Continuous improvement

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Generic or vague insights
Solution: More specific prompts with examples and constraints

### Issue: Missed important tasks
Solution: Multi-pass analysis with task-focused prompt

### Issue: High API costs
Solution: Intelligent routing between models, caching

### Issue: Inconsistent output format
Solution: Structured output schemas with validation

### Issue: Poor cross-reference detection
Solution: Implement embedding-based similarity search

## Performance Metrics

Track these KPIs:
- Insight accuracy rate (user feedback)
- Task completion rate
- Cross-reference relevance
- API cost per analysis
- User engagement with insights
- Time to actionable outcome

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Analysis Models**
   - Train domain-specific models
   - Fine-tune for user preferences
   - Implement active learning

2. **Real-time Analysis**
   - Stream analysis during transcription
   - Progressive insight generation
   - Live collaboration features

3. **Intelligence Amplification**
   - Suggest related research
   - Auto-generate summaries
   - Create knowledge graphs

When enhancing AI analysis, prioritize:
1. Accuracy and relevance of insights
2. Actionability of extracted information
3. Cost-effectiveness of API usage
4. User experience and response time
5. Continuous learning and improvement
