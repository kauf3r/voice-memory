## üîß Troubleshooting

### Auto-Uploader Issues

**"No authentication token found"**
- Run `npm run generate-auth` to create a token
- Or add `VOICE_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token` to `.env` file

**"Authentication token is invalid or expired"**
- Generate a new token: `npm run generate-auth`
- Tokens expire after extended periods

**Files not being detected**
- Ensure files are saved directly to `audio-exports` folder
- Check that file extension is supported (.mp3, .m4a, .wav, etc.)
- Verify auto-uploader is running (`npm run watch-uploads`)

**"File too large" error**
- Maximum file size is 25MB
- Compress or trim longer recordings

### iPhone Shortcuts Issues

**"The operation couldn't be completed"**
- Check your authentication token is correct
- Ensure you're connected to internet
- Verify the API URL is correct

**Shortcut fails at upload step**
- Make sure the voice memo is selected properly
- Check that Headers are set correctly
- Verify Form field key is exactly "file"

## üìÅ File Organization

The auto-uploader organizes files automatically:

```
audio-exports/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Instructions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your-memo.m4a      # New files go here
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ processed/         # Successfully processed files
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your-memo.m4a  # Moved here after processing
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

- **Auth tokens are sensitive** - never share or commit them to git
- The `.voice-memory-auth` file is automatically ignored by git
- Tokens are tied to your user account
- Generate new tokens periodically for security

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Batch Processing
Drop multiple audio files into the folder at once - they'll be processed sequentially.

### Custom Scripts
You can also use the API directly in your own scripts:

```bash
# Upload a file
curl -X POST [YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_URL]/api/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@your-audio.mp3"

# Process a note
curl -X POST [YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_URL]/api/process \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"noteId": "NOTE_ID_HERE"}'
```

### Automation Ideas
- Set up Hazel or Automator to watch Downloads folder
- Create email-to-upload integration
- Build iOS widget for quick access
- Integrate with other voice recording apps

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the terminal output for detailed error messages
2. Verify your authentication is working
3. Ensure audio files are in supported formats
4. Check file permissions on the audio-exports folder
