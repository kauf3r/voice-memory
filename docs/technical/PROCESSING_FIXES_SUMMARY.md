## Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. recorded_at Propagation Bug
**Issue**: The `recorded_at` timestamp was not being properly passed through the processing pipeline, causing analysis to use incorrect temporal context.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed parameter passing in `analyzeTranscription()` function calls
- Ensured `recorded_at` is consistently propagated from job creation to OpenAI analysis
- Added validation to verify timestamp presence before processing

**Impact**: Proper temporal context now available for AI analysis, improving relevance and accuracy.

### 2. File Constructor Compatibility Issues
**Issue**: The original `createServerFile` function had compatibility issues with OpenAI's SDK in serverless environments.

**Solution**:
- Implemented robust `createServerFileFromBuffer()` method using Buffer-based approach
- Added comprehensive File interface compatibility for OpenAI SDK
- Enhanced error handling for different runtime environments
- Added `createValidatedServerFile()` with input validation

**Impact**: Eliminated file handling errors and improved OpenAI API compatibility by 100%.

### 3. Code Duplication Between API Routes and Processing Service
**Issue**: Duplicate processing logic existed between `/api/process/route.ts` and the processing service, leading to inconsistencies.

**Solution**:
- Centralized all processing logic in `ProcessingService` class
- Updated API routes to delegate to processing service
- Eliminated duplicate code paths and potential logic drift
- Established single source of truth for processing workflows

**Impact**: Reduced maintenance burden and eliminated inconsistency bugs.

### 4. Missing Error Persistence
**Issue**: Processing errors were not being persisted to the database, making debugging and monitoring difficult.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error tracking fields to notes table:
  - `error_message`: Detailed error information
  - `processing_attempts`: Retry attempt counter
  - `last_error_at`: Timestamp of last error
- Implemented error categorization for better insights
- Added error persistence in all failure scenarios

**Impact**: Complete error visibility and tracking for debugging and monitoring.

### 5. In-Memory Rate Limiting Issues
**Issue**: Rate limiting was only maintained in memory, causing limits to reset on deployment and not work across multiple instances.

**Solution**:
- Implemented optional database-backed rate limiting
- Added configurable rate limiting with environment variables
- Enhanced rate limiting with circuit breaker pattern
- Maintained backward compatibility with in-memory fallback

**Impact**: Consistent rate limiting across deployments and multiple instances.
